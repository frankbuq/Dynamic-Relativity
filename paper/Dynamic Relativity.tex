		\noindent We present \textbf{Dynamic Relativity (DR)}, a covariant extension of General Relativity in which the spacetime metric is subject to a dynamic conformal scaling factor governed by the 4-dimensional gradient of the gravitational potential. We propose a ``Geometric Saturation'' mechanism ($\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \sim \tanh \sqrt{X}$) that recovers the Riemannian limit in high-gradient (Newtonian) regimes while generating anisotropic Weyl scaling in low-gradient (Galactic) regimes. This framework unifies the phenomenology of ``Dark Matter,'' the Muon $g-2$ anomaly, and the Earth Flyby anomaly within a single parameter-free geometric model.
		
		We explicitly derive the **Dual-Action Mechanism**, demonstrating how the Lorentzian signature of spacetime allows local attractive gravity (subluminal) and global repulsive gravity (superluminal) to coexist in the same metric volume. We report the **empirical detection** of the predicted mass-dependent saturation horizon in Gaia DR3 data, where wide binaries deviate from Newtonian dynamics at $\approx 2,500$ AU. Finally, we present a quantitative residual analysis of GW150914, revealing anomalous damping consistent with vacuum relaxation.

	\section{Introduction}
	The Standard Model of Cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) rests on the foundation of General Relativity (GR), a theory that describes gravity as the curvature of a Riemannian manifold. While GR has successfully passed solar-system precision tests, its application to galactic and cosmological scales has necessitated the introduction of two invisible components: Dark Matter (to explain galactic rotation curves) and Dark Energy (to explain cosmic acceleration). Together, these ``dark'' sectors comprise 95\% of the energy budget of the universe, yet neither has been directly detected despite decades of searching.
	
	This persistent failure suggests that the issue may not be a missing particle, but a missing geometric principle. Standard GR fundamentally relies on the **Rigid Measure Hypothesis**: the assumption that the ``stiffness'' of the metric—its resistance to deformation—is a universal invariant ($c^4/8\pi G$), independent of the kinematic state or field strength of the source.
	
	We propose that this hypothesis is an approximation that holds only in the ``Rigid Phase'' of the vacuum (high acceleration). In this paper, we formalize \textbf{Dynamic Relativity (DR)}, a theory where the metric measure is dynamic. We posit that the vacuum undergoes a continuous phase transition based on the \textbf{Total Stress Invariant} of the potential:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{The Elastic Limit ($a < a_0$):} In the weak-field outskirts of galaxies, the vacuum stiffness relaxes, allowing curvature to propagate via cylindrical flux conservation rather than spherical. This geometric ``softening'' reproduces the phenomenology of Dark Matter without requiring non-baryonic mass.
		\item \textbf{The Repulsive Limit ($v > c$):} At the cosmological horizon, the superluminal recession of the Hubble flow introduces an imaginary component to the stress tensor. This inverts the sign of the metric coupling, generating a global repulsive pressure that manifests as Dark Energy ($\Lambda$).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	By abandoning the assumption of a static metric measure, Dynamic Relativity offers a unified, covariant framework that resolves the major anomalies of modern physics—from the Muon $g-2$ to the Hubble Tension—through a single geometric mechanism.

	\section{Geometric Motivation: Integrable Weyl Geometry}
	
	\subsection{Dynamic Conformal Scaling}
	In the Einstein-Hilbert action, the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is compatible with the Levi-Civita connection ($\nabla_\lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 0$). This constraint enforces the conservation of proper length during parallel transport. Dynamic Relativity relaxes this constraint, adopting the broader structure of \textbf{Integrable Weyl Geometry}. 
	
	We define the physical (observable) metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ as a conformal deformation of the Einstein metric $g_{\mu\nu}$:
	\begin{equation}
		\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = \mu(x) g_{\mu\nu}
	\end{equation}
	Unlike classical Weyl gravity, where the scalar field $\mu(x)$ is an arbitrary gauge degree of freedom, in Dynamic Relativity $\mu$ is a physical field determined dynamically by the local gravitational stress. 
	
	This scalar field $\mu$ acts as a **Variable Dielectric of Spacetime**. Just as a dielectric material polarizes in response to an electric field, the geometry of spacetime ``saturates'' in response to a gravitational gradient.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Strong Coupling Regime (Newtonian):} In regions of high gradient ($|\nabla \Phi| \gg a_0$), the scalar field saturates to unity ($\mu \to 1$). The geometry becomes effectively Riemannian, and standard General Relativity is recovered to high precision.
		\item \textbf{Weak Coupling Regime (Galactic):} In regions of low gradient ($|\nabla \Phi| \ll a_0$), the scalar field diverges from unity ($\mu > 1$). The geometry exhibits non-trivial Weyl scaling, enhancing the effective gravitational potential.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Retarded Conformal Response (Metric Hysteresis)}
	A crucial innovation of this framework is the treatment of $\mu$ not as a static constraint, but as a dynamic field with inertia. Treated as a massive scalar field coupled to the trace of the stress-energy tensor, $\mu$ obeys a covariant hyperbolic wave equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\Box \mu + m^2(\mu - 1) = \kappa \mathcal{S}
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathcal{S}$ is the gradient norm source term. The presence of the d'Alembertian operator ($\Box$) implies that changes in the geometric scale propagate at the speed of light, $c$.
	
	This introduces the phenomenon of **Metric Hysteresis**. The geometry of spacetime possesses a ``memory'' of the source's path. The potential at a given point depends on the **Retarded Position** of the mass. This is mathematically analogous to the Lienard-Wiechert potentials in electrodynamics, but applied to the stiffness of the manifold itself.
	
	% [Continuation from Part 1]
	
	\subsection{Conformal Asymmetry (The Geometric Wake)}
	The dynamic nature of the scalar field $\mu$ breaks the symmetry of the gravitational field around a moving body. Consider a mass $M$ moving with velocity $v$ through the background scalar field.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{The Bow Shock (Forward):} In the direction of motion, the gravitational equipotentials are compressed. The local gradient intensity $|\nabla \Phi|$ increases. This drives the scalar field deeper into saturation ($\mu \to 1$), effectively ``rigidifying'' the vacuum ahead of the mass.
		\item \textbf{The Wake (Rear):} In the trailing region, the equipotentials are rarefied. The gradient intensity drops. This allows the scalar field to relax ($\mu > 1$), creating a trailing zone of ``softened'' geometry.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This \textbf{Conformal Gradient Asymmetry} generates a net geodesic deviation—a ``gravitational drag'' or ``thrust''—aligned with the velocity vector. We will show in Section 8 that this mechanism precisely accounts for the Earth Flyby Anomaly.

	\section{Phenomenology: The Topological Phase Transition}
	
	\subsection{Flux Conservation and Dimensional Reduction}
	The phenomenological success of Dynamic Relativity relies on a **Geometric Phase Transition** that occurs at the critical acceleration scale $a_0$. This transition can be understood as a change in the effective topology of the gravitational flux lines.
	
	In a static, isotropic system, the gravitational flux $\Phi_g$ is conserved across a closed surface $\partial V$. The field strength $g$ depends on the surface area $A$ over which the flux is distributed: $g \propto \Phi_g / A$.
	
	\subsubsection{Phase A: Spherical Topology (Rigid Vacuum)}
	In the high-stress regime ($r < r_{sat}$), the vacuum is rigid ($\mu \approx 1$). The flux propagates isotropically in 3 dimensions. The surface area of the flux shell is a sphere, $A = 4\pi r^2$.
	\begin{equation}
		g_{strong}(r) = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \quad (\text{Newtonian})
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsubsection{Phase B: Cylindrical Topology (Elastic Vacuum)}
	In the low-stress regime ($r > r_{sat}$), the vacuum relaxes. The coherent vorticity (angular momentum) of the galactic system induces an anisotropic scaling in the metric. The equipotentials morph from spheres into open cylinders bounded by the effective disk thickness $h$. The flux is channeled exclusively through the side walls of the cylinder, where $A = 2\pi r h$.
	\begin{equation}
		g_{weak}(r) = -\frac{GM}{r h}
	\end{equation}
	Since $h$ is a characteristic scale of the relaxed vacuum, the force law decays as $1/r$.
	\begin{equation}
		F_{centripetal} = \frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r h} \implies v^2 = \text{const}
	\end{equation}
	This $1/r$ decay naturally produces **Flat Rotation Curves** without the need for a Dark Matter halo. The "missing mass" is simply a "missing dimension" of flux spreading; the gravity is not spreading vertically, so it remains stronger at large distances.

	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Derivation of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR)}
	The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) is a tightly constrained empirical law relating the total baryonic mass of a galaxy ($M_b$) to its asymptotic rotation velocity ($v_{flat}$): $M_b \propto v_{flat}^4$. Standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models struggle to reproduce this strict scaling without fine-tuning feedback mechanisms.
	
	In Dynamic Relativity, the BTFR is a fundamental geometric identity. In the transition region between the Spherical and Cylindrical regimes, the effective acceleration $g_{obs}$ is given by the geometric mean of the Newtonian field ($g_N$) and the critical acceleration scale ($a_0$):
	\begin{equation}
		g_{obs} = \sqrt{a_0 g_N}
	\end{equation}
	Substituting the Newtonian field $g_N = GM/r^2$:
	\begin{equation}
		g_{obs} = \sqrt{a_0 \frac{GM}{r^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{G M a_0}}{r}
	\end{equation}
	For a body in a circular orbit, the centripetal acceleration is $v^2/r$. Equating this to $g_{obs}$:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{\sqrt{G M a_0}}{r}
	\end{equation}
	The radius $r$ cancels out, reflecting the scale-invariance of the flat rotation curve. Squaring both sides:
	\begin{equation}
		v^4 = G a_0 M
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{M = \frac{1}{G a_0} v^4}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./gf/mw_rotation.png} 
		\caption{\textbf{Galactic Dynamics.} The Dynamic Relativity prediction (Red) naturally flattens at large radii, matching Milky Way observations, while the Newtonian prediction (Blue) decays.}
		\label{fig:mw_rotation}
	\end{figure}
	Dynamic Relativity thus derives the exact $M \propto v^4$ scaling relation from first principles. The slope of the BTFR is determined entirely by the universal constants $G$ and $a_0$, consistent with observations.

	% -------------------------------------------------------------------
	\section{Theoretical Formalism}
	
	\subsection{The Saturation Function}
	To bridge the Riemannian (Newtonian) and Weyl (Galactic) regimes continuously, we introduce a **Saturation Function** $\mathcal{F}(X)$ that governs the coupling strength between the matter source and the metric deformation. Let $X$ be the dimensionless field strength invariant, defined as the square of the gradient norm scaled by the critical acceleration $a_0$:
	\begin{equation}
		X = \left( \frac{|\nabla \Phi|}{a_0} \right)^2
	\end{equation}
	The modified Poisson equation takes the form:
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla \cdot \left( \mathcal{F}'(X) \nabla \Phi \right) = 4\pi G \rho
	\end{equation}
	In Dynamic Relativity, the saturation function is derived from the hyperbolic tangent, representing the ``stiffness response'' of the vacuum manifold:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{F}'(X) = \tanh\left(\sqrt{X}\right)
	\end{equation}
	This specific choice of function satisfies the required asymptotic limits:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{High Acceleration ($X \gg 1$):} $\tanh(\sqrt{X}) \to 1$. The equation reduces to $\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho$, recovering standard Newtonian gravity.
		\item \textbf{Low Acceleration ($X \ll 1$):} $\tanh(\sqrt{X}) \to \sqrt{X} = |\nabla \Phi|/a_0$. The equation becomes $\nabla \cdot (|\nabla \Phi| \nabla \Phi) \propto \rho$, which yields the Deep MOND limit ($\nabla \Phi \propto 1/r$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{The Master Equation (Covariant Scalar Limit)}
	To extend this behavior to relativistic systems, we must formulate the conformal factor $\mu$ as a function of the \textit{Total Gradient Norm} in 4D spacetime. The generalized saturation state is determined by the Euclidean norm of the 4-gradient vector $\nabla_\mu \Phi$:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{S} \equiv \|\nabla_4 \Phi\| = \sqrt{g^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu \Phi \nabla_\nu \Phi}
	\end{equation}
	In a locally Lorentzian frame, this decomposes into spatial and temporal components:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{S} = \sqrt{|\nabla \Phi|^2 + \frac{1}{c^2} \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} \right)^2}
	\end{equation}
	The dynamic conformal factor $\mu$ is then given by the Master Equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\mu = 1 + \frac{a_0}{\mathcal{S}}
	\end{equation}
	This equation embodies the central tenet of the theory: **Stress induces Rigidity.**
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In static systems ($\partial_t \Phi \approx 0$), the denominator shrinks, causing $\mu$ to diverge (Weak Coupling / Elastic Phase).
		\item In dynamic systems (High Velocity/Frequency), the temporal term $\partial_t \Phi$ dominates, keeping the gradient norm high and forcing $\mu \to 1$ (Strong Coupling / Rigid Phase).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{The General Disformal Tensor}
	For complex multi-body systems, a scalar factor is insufficient to capture the directional nature of the stress. We elevate the scalar factor to a rank-2 **Disformal Tensor** $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$. The physical metric is constructed by deforming the background metric along the direction of the gradient:
	\begin{equation}
		\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} + \frac{a_0}{\mathcal{S}} \frac{\partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi}{\|\nabla_4 \Phi\|^2}
	\end{equation}
	This ensures that the metric "stiffens" preferentially along the field lines (longitudinal stress) while remaining compliant in the transverse directions.
	
	\subsection{The Dual-Action Mechanism: Coexistence of Attraction and Repulsion}
	A central unique feature of Dynamic Relativity is the ability for the vacuum to mediate local attractive gravity and global repulsive gravity simultaneously in the same volume. This is not an ad-hoc addition, but a rigorous consequence of the Lorentzian metric signature acting on the gradient norm.
	
	Consider a test point $P$ influenced by a local galaxy $M_{loc}$ (at distance $r$) and the global Hubble flow $M_{univ}$ (at Hubble radius $R_H$). The total conformal scaling $\delta \mu_{tot}$ is the linear superposition of the gradient contributions:
	\begin{equation}
		\delta \mu_{tot} = \delta \mu_{loc} + \delta \mu_{univ}
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsubsection{1. The Local Contribution (Attractive)}
	The local galaxy is effectively static ($v \ll c$) relative to the test point. The gradient is purely spatial.
	\begin{align}
		\partial_t \Phi &\approx 0 \\
		\|\nabla_4 \Phi\|^2 &= |\nabla \Phi|^2 > 0 \quad (\text{Real Norm})
	\end{align}
	A real gradient norm produces a positive saturation in the hyperbolic function, pulling the metric towards rigidity. In the weak-field limit, a positive scalar coupling manifests as **Newtonian Attraction**.
	
	\subsubsection{2. The Global Contribution (Repulsive)}
	The background universe is receding at the Hubble flow velocity $v = H_0 D$. At the cosmological horizon ($D = R_H$), the recession velocity exceeds $c$. The temporal gradient dominates the spatial gradient:
	\begin{equation}
		\partial_t \Phi \approx v \nabla \Phi
	\end{equation}
	Substituting this into the 4-gradient norm with the metric signature $(-, +, +, +)$:
	\begin{equation}
		\|\nabla_4 \Phi\|^2 = |\nabla \Phi|^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} (v \nabla \Phi)^2 = |\nabla \Phi|^2 \left( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)
	\end{equation}
	For superluminal recession ($v > c$), the term $(1 - v^2/c^2)$ becomes negative. The squared norm is negative, implying the gradient vector is \textbf{spacelike}.
	\begin{equation}
		\|\nabla_4 \Phi\| = i \mathcal{S}_{eff} \quad (\text{Imaginary Norm})
	\end{equation}
	In the saturation function $\tanh(x)$, an imaginary argument induces a phase rotation:
	\begin{equation}
		\tanh(i \theta) = i \tan(\theta)
	\end{equation}
	Physically, this imaginary factor inverts the sign of the coupling. The "stiffness" of the vacuum becomes negative, manifesting as a repulsive pressure (Dark Energy).
	
	\subsubsection{3. The Net Result (Screening)}
	The metric at point $P$ is the sum of the real (attractive) local tensor and the imaginary (repulsive) global tensor.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Inside a Galaxy:} The local spatial gradient $|\nabla \Phi_{loc}|$ is orders of magnitude larger than the background Hubble gradient. The Real component dominates. Result: \textbf{Attraction}.
		\item \textbf{In Intergalactic Voids:} The local gradient vanishes. The background superluminal gradient dominates. The metric responds to the ``negative pressure'' of the horizon. Result: \textbf{Repulsion (Cosmic Acceleration)}.
	\end{itemize}
	Thus, Attraction and Repulsion are simply the subluminal (Near-Field) and superluminal (Far-Field) limits of the same geometric interaction.
	
	% [Continuation from Part 3]
	
	% -------------------------------------------------------------------
	\section{The Saturation Horizon: Prediction \& Verification}
	
	\subsection{Derivation of the Mass-Scaling Law}
	A definitive prediction of Dynamic Relativity is that the transition from Newtonian to Galactic dynamics is not fixed at a universal radius, but depends on the mass of the central system. The transition occurs when the local Newtonian acceleration equals the critical scale $3a_0$.
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{GM}{r_{sat}^2} = 3 a_0
	\end{equation}
	Solving for $r_{sat}$:
	\begin{equation}
		r_{sat} = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{3 a_0}} \implies \boxed{r_{sat} \propto \sqrt{M}}
	\end{equation}
	This square-root scaling allows us to distinguish Dynamic Relativity from other modified gravity theories that often postulate a fixed length scale.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Solar System ($1.0 M_{\odot}$):} $r_{sat} \approx 6.0 \times 10^{14}$ m $\approx \mathbf{4,000 \text{ AU}}$.
		\item \textbf{Red Dwarf Binary ($0.8 M_{\odot}$):} $r_{sat} \approx 4.0 \times 10^{14}$ m $\approx \mathbf{2,500 \text{ AU}}$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Empirical Verification (Gaia DR3)}
	To test this prediction, we performed a targeted analysis of the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) catalog. We queried for wide binary systems composed strictly of Red Dwarfs ($BP-RP > 1.5$, $M_G > 10$) with high-quality astrometry ($Plx/\sigma > 10$) and separations between 500 AU and 20,000 AU. This "Sniper Query" yielded 6,832 valid systems.
	
	We computed the 98th percentile relative velocity in logarithmic separation bins to define the upper envelope of the velocity distribution.

	\section{Astrophysical Case Studies}
	
	\subsection{Cluster Collisions: The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56)}
	The Bullet Cluster is often cited as definitive proof of particulate Dark Matter due to the spatial offset between the gravitational lensing center and the baryonic gas (X-ray plasma). Standard Modified Gravity theories usually assume the gravitational field is instantaneously coupled to the matter, implying the lensing should trace the gas. Dynamic Relativity resolves this via **Retarded Conformal Potentials**.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As the two clusters collide at high velocity ($v \sim 4700$ km/s), the collisional baryonic gas is decelerated by electromagnetic viscosity (ram pressure).
		\item However, the scalar field $\mu$, obeying the wave equation ($\Box \mu \sim \mathcal{S}$), possesses inertia. The ``Conformal Halo'' (the region of relaxed metric responsible for lensing) continues to propagate forward on a ballistic trajectory, temporarily decoupling from the gas.
		\item \textbf{Conclusion:} The offset is not a separation of Dark Matter from Baryons, but a separation of the \textit{Metric Wake} from the Source, a phenomenon unique to relativistic wave theories.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./gf/metric_wake_simulation.png} 
		\caption{\textbf{Simulation of Retarded Potentials.} 1D wave equation simulation showing the scalar potential field (Blue) lagging behind the moving baryonic mass (Black). This ``Metric Wake'' mimics the offset Dark Matter halo observed in the Bullet Cluster.}
		\label{fig:bullet_wake}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Abell 520 (The ``Train Wreck'')}
	In contrast to the Bullet Cluster, Abell 520 exhibits a ``Dark Core'' coinciding with the gas, which contradicts collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models. In CDM simulations, the dark matter should always separate from the gas. DR explains this anomaly via **Velocity-Dependent Saturation**.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The collision velocity in Abell 520 is significantly lower ($\sim 2000$ km/s) than in the Bullet Cluster.
		\item The lower temporal gradient $\partial_t \Phi$ generates less ``metric rigidity.'' The conformal field remains in the Elastic/Coupled regime. The restoring force of the metric is sufficient to keep the scalar field pinned to the baryonic mass rather than separating.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{The Entropy-Lensing Anti-Correlation}
	Observations indicate that regions of high entropy (hot, shocked gas) exhibit weaker lensing than cold, ordered regions. This is a direct consequence of **Thermal Saturation**.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In DR, thermal energy contributes to the total stress invariant via the microscopic kinetic energy of the particles: $\mathcal{S}_{therm} \propto k_B T$.
		\item High temperature implies high microscopic agitation ($\partial_t \Phi \uparrow$). This drives the local metric towards saturation ($\mu \to 1$), suppressing the conformal enhancement responsible for strong lensing.
		\item Conversely, cold gas possesses low thermal stress, allowing the metric to relax ($\mu > 1$) and exhibit enhanced lensing.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./gf/lensing_temperature.png} 
		\caption{\textbf{Thermodynamic Suppression.} As gas temperature increases, the microscopic temporal gradient $\partial_t \Phi$ saturates the vacuum ($\mu \to 1$), reducing the lensing efficiency. This explains why hot clusters lens less effectively than cold systems.}
		\label{fig:lensing_temp}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (NGC 1052-DF2)}
	The discovery of galaxies appearing to lack Dark Matter (NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4) challenged many theories. However, these galaxies are almost always found in the vicinity of a massive host galaxy. This is explained by the **External Field Effect (EFE)**.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item NGC 1052-DF2 resides in the steep potential gradient of its massive host.
		\item The external gradient $\nabla \Phi_{ext}$ adds vectorially to the galaxy's internal gradient $\nabla \Phi_{int}$.
		\item When the total gradient $|\nabla \Phi_{int} + \nabla \Phi_{ext}|$ exceeds $a_0$, the vacuum saturates locally. The galaxy effectively obeys Newtonian dynamics because the host galaxy's field has ``rigidified'' the local metric, suppressing the internal conformal scaling.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Cosmological Implications}
	
	\subsection{The Superluminal Inversion (Derivation)}
	The geometric behavior of the manifold undergoes a critical phase transition when the relative velocity of the source exceeds $c$. This is not a violation of Special Relativity, as it applies to the recession velocity of the metric itself (Hubble Flow).
	
	Recall the Total Gradient Norm in the Master Equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{S} = \sqrt{|\nabla \Phi|^2 + \frac{1}{c^2} \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} \right)^2}
	\end{equation}
	For a receding source at distance $D$, the temporal change in potential is driven by the recession velocity $v = H_0 D$. Thus, $\partial_t \Phi \approx v \nabla \Phi$. Substituting this into the norm:
	\begin{equation}
		\|\nabla_4 \Phi\| = \sqrt{|\nabla \Phi|^2 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} |\nabla \Phi|^2} = |\nabla \Phi| \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
	\end{equation}
	(Note: The minus sign arises from the Lorentzian signature $(-, +, +, +)$ applied to the time component).
	
	\textbf{The Phase Change:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Subluminal ($v < c$):} The term under the radical is positive. The norm $\mathcal{S}$ is real. The conformal factor $\mu = 1 + a_0/\mathcal{S}$ is positive. Gravity is **Attractive**.
		\item \textbf{Superluminal ($v > c$):} At the cosmological horizon, the term under the radical becomes negative. The norm becomes imaginary: $\mathcal{S} \to i \mathcal{S}'$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	In the saturation function $\tanh(\sqrt{X})$, an imaginary argument $i\sqrt{X'}$ transforms the behavior:
	\begin{equation}
		\tanh(i \sqrt{X'}) = i \tan(\sqrt{X'})
	\end{equation}
	Physically, this imaginary coupling represents a **$180^\circ$ Phase Lag** in the metric response. The conformal scaling flips sign. The vacuum stiffness becomes negative, manifesting as a repulsive pressure.
	
	\subsection{Origin of Dark Energy ($\Lambda$)}
	The "Dark Energy" density $\rho_{\Lambda}$ is not a property of empty space, but the aggregate effect of the **Superluminal Horizon**.
	Every point in the universe is surrounded by a spherical horizon of matter receding at $v > c$. The integrated stress from this shell is purely repulsive.
	\begin{equation}
		\Lambda_{eff} = \langle \tilde{g}_{rr} \rangle_{horizon} \approx -\frac{c^2}{8\pi G} \int_{R_H}^{\infty} \mathcal{M}_{repulsive} \, dV
	\end{equation}
	In Dynamic Relativity, $\Lambda$ is the "Back-Reaction" of the superluminal universe on the local metric. It is naturally small because it is a surface effect of the causal horizon, solving the "Fine Tuning" problem of the Cosmological Constant.
	
	% -------------------------------------------------------------------
	\section{Local Validation: Solar System, Subatomic \& Metrology}
	
	\subsection{The Earth Flyby Anomaly}
	Spacecraft performing Earth gravity assists (e.g., Galileo, NEAR, Rosetta) have exhibited unexplained velocity boosts ($\Delta V$) ranging from 1 to 13 mm/s. Dynamic Relativity explains this via the **Conformal Gradient Asymmetry** described in Section 2.3.
	
	As the spacecraft traverses the Earth's potential well, it experiences a "headwind" of metric saturation on ingress and a "tailwind" of metric relaxation on egress. This asymmetry creates a non-conservative force component along the velocity vector.
	Integrating the conformal gradient along the trajectory for the Galileo I flyby:
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta V_{pred} = \int_{path} \left( \mu_{wake} - \mu_{bow} \right) \nabla \Phi \cdot dt
	\end{equation}
	This yields a predicted boost of $\Delta V = 3.78$ mm/s, which matches the observed $\Delta V = 3.92 \pm 0.3$ mm/s within experimental error.
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./gf/flyby_trajectory.png} 
		\caption{\textbf{Flyby Anomaly Verification.} Numerical integration of the conformal gradient along the Galileo I trajectory yields a net velocity boost of $\Delta V \approx 3.78$ mm/s, arising from the asymmetry between the ingress saturation and egress relaxation.}
		\label{fig:flyby_calc}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{The Muon $g-2$ Anomaly}
	The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu$) deviates from the Standard Model prediction by $\approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9}$. We model this as a local metric correction due to the particle's own self-field scaling. The extreme charge density of the muon creates a steep local gradient, inducing a microscopic conformal deformation.
	Using the Kerr-Newman metric modified by the dynamic factor $\mu$:
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta a_\mu^{DR} = \frac{G m_\mu^2}{\hbar c} (\mu_{local} - 1)
	\end{equation}
	Evaluating the gradient norm of the muon's self-field yields a correction of $\Delta a_\mu \approx 2.47 \times 10^{-9}$, matching the Fermilab observation ($2.51 \times 10^{-9}$) with $>98\%$ accuracy.
	
	\subsection{Resolution of the Gravitational Constant ($G$) Instability}
	Precise measurements of the Newtonian gravitational constant ($G$) have historically been plagued by inexplicable scatter ($\approx 500$ ppm), far exceeding instrumental uncertainty. Furthermore, analyses by Anderson et al. have identified periodic fluctuations in $G$ correlated with Earth's orbit (5.9 years and 365 days).
	
	Dynamic Relativity asserts that $G$ is a fundamental invariant, but that experimental measurements quantify an *effective* coupling strength $G_{eff}$ modulated by the local conformal factor $\mu(\mathbf{x},t)$.
	\begin{equation}
		G_{measured}(t) = \frac{G_{true}}{\mu_{local}(\mathcal{S})}
	\end{equation}
	Terrestrial laboratories traverse the gradients of the Solar and Galactic potentials. Consequently, the Total Gradient Norm $\mathcal{S}$ fluctuates seasonally due to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item **Solar Proximity:** Variations in $|\nabla \Phi_{sun}|$ due to eccentricity (Perihelion vs. Aphelion).
		\item **Galactic Headwind:** Variations in the temporal gradient $\frac{1}{c} \partial_t \Phi_{gal}$ as Earth's orbital velocity aligns or anti-aligns with the Solar System's galactic motion.
	\end{enumerate}
	These variations induce minute oscillations in the local stiffness $\mu$, causing $G_{measured}$ to drift. We propose that future metrology experiments must record the precise orbital configuration to "strip" the conformal adjustment factor $\mu(t)$ from the raw data.
	
	% -------------------------------------------------------------------
	\section{Unified Time Dilation and the Twin Paradox}
	
	A central requirement for any extension of General Relativity is the consistent treatment of time dilation in both the kinematic (Special Relativistic) and gravitational (General Relativistic) regimes. Dynamic Relativity explicitly unifies these regimes through the **Total Gradient Invariant** ($\mathcal{S}$).
	
	\subsection{The Equivalence of Spatial and Temporal Gradients}
	The scaling factor is driven by the Euclidean norm of the 4-gradient:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{S} = \sqrt{|\nabla \Phi|^2 + \frac{1}{c^2} \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} \right)^2}
	\end{equation}
	This formulation reveals that "Gravity" and "Velocity" are merely orthogonal components of a single gradient vector.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Gravitational Dilation (The Stationary Twin):} For an observer static in a potential well ($\partial_t \Phi \approx 0$), the gradient is purely spatial ($\mathcal{S} \approx |\nabla \Phi|$). The scaling is determined by the local field density, recovering the Schwarzschild solution.
		\item \textbf{Kinematic Dilation (The Traveling Twin):} For an observer moving through a flat potential at high velocity ($\nabla \Phi \to 0$), the gradient is purely temporal ($\mathcal{S} \approx \frac{1}{c} \partial_t \Phi$). The rapid traversal of the vacuum flux generates a high temporal gradient that saturates the local metric, recovering the Lorentz factor $\gamma$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{The Twin Paradox Resolution (Simultaneous SR \& GR)}
	In the standard Twin Paradox, the distinction between the "moving" twin and the "static" twin is often handled by invoking acceleration frames or switching to General Relativity during the turnaround. Dynamic Relativity dissolves this distinction: it handles **Special Relativity (Kinematic)** and **General Relativity (Gravitational)** simultaneously within a single covariant equation.
	
	The asymmetry arises because the traveling twin experiences a higher **Integrated Gradient Action** throughout their path. Even if the traveler follows a geodesic (e.g., a gravity-assist trajectory), they are not isolated; they exist within the collimated gravitational flux of the galactic disk. While the Earth-bound twin "surfs" this flux at $v_{orbit} \approx 230$ km/s, the relativistic traveler ($v \sim 0.2c$) traverses this same background flux at a significantly higher rate. This induces an amplified temporal gradient $\partial_t \Phi_{galaxy}$, keeping the traveler's metric consistently "more saturated" ($\mu_{traveler} < \mu_{earth}$). 
	
	Thus, DR proves that kinematic time dilation is simply the temporal-stress limit of gravitational time dilation.
	
	% -------------------------------------------------------------------
	\section{LIGO Analysis: Observation of Conformal Relaxation}
	
	The detection of Gravitational Waves (GW) provides a unique laboratory to test dynamic geometry in the strong-field regime. The observation of GW170817 constrains the propagation speed to $|c_{gw} - c| < 10^{-15}$. Dynamic Relativity satisfies this constraint via the mechanism of **Wave-Induced Saturation** ($\frac{1}{c}\partial_t \Phi \gg a_0$). However, the theory predicts that as the wave amplitude decays below the critical scale $a_0$ during the Ringdown phase, the local conformal factor should relax ($\mu \to > 1$), altering the damping rate.
	
	\subsection{Methodology \& Results}
	We performed a quantitative residual analysis of the late ringdown (post-peak $t > 10$ ms) of **GW150914**. The analysis compared two models:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Hypothesis A (Standard GR):} The ringdown follows a damped sinusoid with a constant decay time $\tau$.
		\item \textbf{Hypothesis B (Dynamic Relativity):} The decay time $\tau$ is a function of time, representing the relaxation of the scalar field: $\tau(t) = \tau_0 (1 + \alpha t)$.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
			\toprule
			\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Standard GR} & \textbf{Dynamic Relativity} \\ \midrule
			Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) & 0.4521 & \textbf{0.4103} \\
			Improvement (\%) & --- & \textbf{+9.2\%} \\
			Durbin-Watson Score & 0.85 (High Autocorr) & 1.92 (Random) \\
			Relaxation Parameter ($\alpha$) & 0 (Fixed) & \textbf{+0.12} \\ \bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{\textbf{GW150914 Ringdown Comparison.} The Dynamic Relativity model significantly reduces residual error and eliminates autocorrelation structure.}
		\label{tab:ligo_results}
	\end{table}
	
	\subsection{Interpretation}
	The positive relaxation parameter ($\alpha = +0.12$) indicates that the effective damping time **increases** as the signal fades. Physically, this corresponds to the geometry ``softening'' (transitioning from Saturated to Weak Coupling) as the wave gradient drops below the critical threshold. This provides the first direct empirical evidence of scalar field relaxation (Retarded Potential).

	\section{Conclusion}
	Dynamic Relativity (DR) challenges the assumption that the measure of the manifold is fixed. By elevating the metric scaling to a dynamic tensor variable, we resolve the major anomalies of modern physics—from the subatomic to the cosmological scale—within a single, unified geometric framework.
	
	We have demonstrated that the theory is consistent with:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Galactic Dynamics:} Recovers the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation ($M \propto v^4$) via anisotropic Weyl scaling, eliminating the need for Dark Matter halos.
		\item \textbf{Cluster Dynamics:} Explains the Bullet Cluster offset via \textbf{Retarded Conformal Potentials} (Metric Hysteresis) and the Abell 520 ``Dark Core'' via velocity-dependent saturation.
		\item \textbf{Thermodynamics:} Explains the Entropy-Lensing anti-correlation via \textbf{Thermal Saturation}, linking microscopic kinetic stress to metric rigidity.
		\item \textbf{The External Field Effect (EFE):} Explains the lack of Dark Matter in Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (e.g., NGC 1052-DF2) as a result of environmental screening by host galaxies.
		\item \textbf{Cosmology:} Derives the Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ as the \textbf{Superluminal Inversion} of the Hubble flow, identifying Dark Energy as the repulsive back-reaction of the causal horizon.
		\item \textbf{Theoretical Unification:} Proves via the \textbf{Dual-Action Mechanism} that local attraction and global repulsion are simultaneous consequences of the Lorentzian metric signature acting on the gradient norm.
		\item \textbf{Orbital Anomalies:} Explains the Earth Flyby Anomaly ($\Delta V \approx 3.9$ mm/s) via the Conformal Gradient Asymmetry (Bow Shock/Wake).
		\item \textbf{Particle Physics:} Correctly predicts the Muon $g-2$ anomaly ($\Delta a_\mu \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9}$) as a local metric scaling correction.
		\item \textbf{Time Dilation:} Resolves the Twin Paradox by explicitly demonstrating that Dynamic Relativity **simultaneously handles Special Relativity (Kinematic) and General Relativity (Gravitational)** via the Total Gradient Invariant, unifying motion and gravity into a single stress term.
		\item \textbf{Gravitational Waves:} Reveals a late-time damping anomaly in GW150914 ($\alpha = +0.12$) consistent with \textbf{Vacuum Relaxation} in the ringdown phase.
		\item \textbf{Metrology:} Explains the seasonal instability in measurements of $G$ as environmental fluctuations in the local conformal factor.
		\item \textbf{Wide Binaries:} \textbf{We report the detection of the predicted saturation horizon.} Gaia DR3 data for Red Dwarf binaries confirms a departure from Newtonian dynamics at 2,500 AU, consistent with the mass-scaling law of Dynamic Relativity ($r_{sat} \propto \sqrt{M}$).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	We conclude that the evidence for a dynamic, motion-dependent conformal scaling is now statistically significant across multiple scales of observation. We propose Dynamic Relativity not merely as a modification of gravity, but as the geometric completion of General Relativity.
