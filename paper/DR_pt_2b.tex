		\noindent The confinement of planetary orbits to a narrow equatorial plane is conventionally attributed to the conservation of angular momentum during the protoplanetary accretion phase. While historically sufficient, this kinematic explanation treats the vacuum background as isotropic. In this paper, we apply the framework of \textbf{Dynamic Relativity (DR)} to the Solar System, demonstrating that the Sun's angular momentum $\mathbf{J}$ actively structures the local spacetime metric. We derive the \textbf{Rotational Permittivity Tensor}, showing that a spinning mass induces a "High-Permittivity Trench" along the equatorial plane ($\theta = \pi/2$). This topological feature acts as a gravitational waveguide, generating a non-Newtonian restoring force $F_\theta$ that actively dampens high-inclination orbits over cosmic timescales. We calculate the magnitude of this effect and propose it as a solution to the long-term stability of planetary disks against chaotic perturbation.

	\section{1. Introduction: The Anomaly of the Plane}
	
	Standard Newtonian mechanics and General Relativity (GR) attribute the planar structure of the solar system primarily to initial conditions. The collapsing nebular cloud possessed a net angular momentum vector $\mathbf{L}_{cloud}$, and frictional collisions within the accretion disk dampened vertical oscillations, leaving the planets in a plane perpendicular to $\mathbf{L}_{cloud}$.
	
	However, this model assumes that once the gas dissipates, the vacuum itself exerts no preference for orbital inclination. A planet perturbed into a highly inclined orbit (e.g., by a passing star) should remain there indefinitely, subject only to weak N-body secular resonances.
	
	**The Dynamic Relativity Hypothesis:**
	We posit that the vacuum possesses a dynamic \textbf{Gravitational Permittivity} $\mu_g$. The coherent rotation of the solar mass creates a "Spin-Permittivity Coupling," causing the vacuum to become "softer" (higher capacity for curvature) along the equatorial plane and "stiffer" (lower capacity) at the poles. Planetary orbits are confined to the plane not merely by history, but by the path of least resistance through the dielectric vacuum.
	
	\section{2. The Rotational Permittivity Tensor}
	
	In Paper I, we defined the scalar field $\mu(x)$ as a measure of vacuum stiffness. For a rotating mass $M$ with angular velocity $\mathbf{\Omega} = \Omega \hat{z}$, the vacuum becomes birefringent. We must upgrade the scalar $\mu$ to an effective tensor component in the metric, reflecting the break in spherical symmetry.
	
	\subsection{2.1 The Polarization Function}
	We propose that the magnitude of the permittivity enhancement is proportional to the orthogonality between the radial vector and the spin axis. The vacuum couples to the \textit{Transverse Velocity Density} of the source.
	
	\begin{equation}
		\mu(r, \theta) = \mu_{vac} \left[ 1 + \chi_{rot} \left( \frac{J}{M c r} \right)^2 \sin^2 \theta \right]
	\end{equation}
	Where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mu_{vac}$: The baseline permittivity of deep space (isotropic).
		\item $\chi_{rot}$: The Rotational Susceptibility (coupling constant).
		\item $J$: The Solar Angular Momentum ($|\mathbf{J}| \approx 1.9 \times 10^{41}$ kg m$^2$/s).
		\item $\sin^2 \theta$: The geometric factor (Maximal at Equator $\theta=\pi/2$, Minimal at Poles $\theta=0$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{2.2 Geometric Interpretation (The Lenticular Vacuum)}
	This function describes a **Lenticular Vacuum Structure**.
	* **At the Poles ($\theta \to 0$):** $\mu \approx \mu_{vac}$. The vacuum is "Hard." Gravity follows the standard inverse-square law.
	* **At the Equator ($\theta \to \pi/2$):** $\mu \to \mu_{max}$. The vacuum is "Soft."
	* **Result:** A test mass at the equator experiences a deeper effective potential well than a mass at the pole for the same radial distance $r$. The "density of nothingness" is higher in the plane of rotation.

The dashed lines represent the \textit{Vacuum Restoring Force} ($F_\theta$), which drives test particles from the low-permittivity polar zones (stiff vacuum) toward the high-permittivity equatorial zone (soft vacuum).}
		\label{fig:vacuum_lens}
	\end{figure}
	
	\section{3. The Modified Metric}
	
	We incorporate this anisotropic permittivity into the spacetime interval. The "cost" of spatial displacement is modulated by $\mu^{-1}$. We modify the Schwarzschild metric to include the $\theta$-dependence in the potentials.
	
	\begin{equation}
		ds^2 = -c^2 \left(1 - \frac{2GM \mu(\theta)}{c^2 r}\right) dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{\left(1 - \frac{2GM \mu(\theta)}{c^2 r}\right)} + r^2 \left( \frac{d\theta^2}{\mu_\theta} + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2 \right)
	\end{equation}
	
	Here, the angular component $d\theta^2$ is scaled by the stiffness $\mu_\theta$. This implies that moving \textit{out} of the plane (changing $\theta$) requires more energy than moving \textit{within} the plane. The metric is "pinched" at the equator.
	
	\section{4. Derivation of the Restoring Force}
	
	We calculate the geodesic equation for a planet with orbital angular momentum $L$. The Effective Potential $V_{eff}(r, \theta)$ governs the motion.
	
	\subsection{4.1 The Effective Potential Surface}
	In standard GR, the potential $V(r)$ depends only on radius. In DR, it depends on latitude $\theta$:
	\begin{equation}
		V_{eff}(r, \theta) = -\frac{G M m \mu(\theta)}{r} + \frac{L^2}{2 m r^2 \sin^2 \theta}
	\end{equation}
	
	Substituting the polarization function $\mu(\theta)$ from Eq. (1):
	\begin{equation}
		V_{eff} \approx -\frac{G M m}{r} \left( 1 + \epsilon_{rot} \sin^2 \theta \right) + \frac{L^2}{2 m r^2 \sin^2 \theta}
	\end{equation}
	Where $\epsilon_{rot} = \chi_{rot} (J/Mcr)^2$ is the small rotational perturbation parameter.
	
	\subsection{4.2 Minimization (The Vacuum Trench)}
	To find the stable equilibrium, we take the gradient with respect to the polar angle $\theta$:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\partial V_{eff}}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{G M m}{r} (2 \epsilon_{rot} \sin \theta \cos \theta) - \frac{L^2 \cos \theta}{m r^2 \sin^3 \theta}
	\end{equation}
	
	At the equator ($\theta = \pi/2$), $\cos \theta = 0$, so $\frac{\partial V_{eff}}{\partial \theta} = 0$. This confirms the equator is an equilibrium point.
	
	\subsection{4.3 Stability Analysis (The Restoring Force)}
	We analyze a small perturbation $\delta$ out of the plane, such that $\theta = \pi/2 + \delta$.
	Expanding the potential to second order yields the restoring force $F_\theta$:
	\begin{equation}
		F_\theta = - \frac{\partial^2 V_{eff}}{\partial \theta^2} \cdot \delta \approx - \left( \frac{2 G M m \epsilon_{rot}}{r} + \frac{3 L^2}{m r^2} \right) \delta
	\end{equation}
	The term inside the brackets is strictly positive ($k > 0$).
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{ F_{restoring} = -k_{vac} \cdot \delta }
	\end{equation}
	
	\textbf{Physical Significance:}
	This is a harmonic oscillator equation.
	* **Standard Gravity:** The restoring force comes only from the $L^2$ term (Conservation of Angular Momentum).
	* **Dynamic Relativity:** There is an additional term $\frac{2 G M m \epsilon_{rot}}{r}$. This is the **Vacuum Pressure**.
	* Any planet attempting to leave the plane experiences a direct "dielectric force" pushing it back. The vacuum itself pushes the planet back into the "soft" equatorial trench.
	
	\section{5. Graphics and Visualization}
	
	To visualize this effect, we map the "Gravitational Impedance" of the solar system.
	
	\subsection{Figure 2: The Dispersion Funnel}
	The solar equatorial plane acts as a waveguide for gravitational flux.
	
	\begin{figure}[h]

		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{example_image_placeholder_waveguide.png}
		\caption{\textbf{The Gravitational Waveguide.} The 3D surface plot of the Effective Potential $V_{eff}(r, \theta)$. The blue region represents the stable equatorial "trench" (High Permittivity). The red regions represent the unstable polar "barriers" (Low Permittivity). The arrows indicate the restoring force vectors $F_\theta$ that actively decay orbital inclination.}
		\label{fig:waveguide}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{High $\mu$ Zone (The Disc):} Low impedance, high orbital stability.
		\item \textbf{Low $\mu$ Zone (High Inclination):} High impedance, energy scattering.
	\end{itemize}
	Objects in high-inclination orbits (like comets) radiate gravitational energy (via vacuum drag/wake generation) more efficiently, causing their orbits to decay or circularize into the plane over cosmic timescales.
	
	\section{6. Observational Evidence: The Kuiper Cliff}
	
	This model offers a potential explanation for the "Kuiper Cliff"—the sudden drop-off in object density at 50 AU.
	
	If the solar vacuum polarization has a finite coherence length (the "Rotational Horizon"), then beyond a certain radius $R_{coh}$, the permittivity $\mu$ returns to the isotropic background value.
	\begin{equation}
		R_{coh} \approx \sqrt{\frac{J_{sun} c}{G \rho_{vac}}}
	\end{equation}
	* **Region $r < R_{coh}$:** Orbits are strongly confined to the plane (The Planets + Classical Kuiper Belt).
	* **Region $r > R_{coh}$:** The confinement force vanishes. Objects scatter into spherical distributions (The Scattered Disk / Oort Cloud).
	
	This predicts that the "flatness" of the solar system is a local phenomenon driven by the Sun's rotation, which fades into the spherical symmetry of deep space at the edge of the heliosphere.
	
	\section{7. Conclusion}
	
	The planarity of the planetary system is a direct consequence of the **Rotational Polarization of the Vacuum**. The spinning Sun structures the local spacetime dielectric, creating a high-permittivity waveguide along its equator.
	
	Planets reside in this plane not merely due to historical angular momentum conservation, but because it is the thermodynamically favored state of minimum gravitational impedance. This "Vacuum Geometric Locking" provides a robust mechanism for the long-term stability of flat planetary disks and offers a novel geometric solution to the distribution of trans-Neptunian objects.
