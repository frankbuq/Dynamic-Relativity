		\noindent The standard $\Lambda$CDM model attributes the observed accelerated expansion of the universe to "Dark Energy," a mysterious fluid with negative pressure comprising 70\% of the cosmic energy budget. In this paper, we apply the framework of \textbf{Dynamic Relativity (DR)} to the FLRW metric. We demonstrate that the "cosmological constant" is not a constant, but a dynamical term arising from the temporal relaxation of the Gravitational Permittivity field $\mu(t)$. As the universe evolves, the vacuum "softens," releasing stored geometric potential energy. We derive the \textbf{Dynamic Friedman Equations}, showing that the time-derivative of the permittivity $\dot{\mu}$ generates a negative pressure term $P_{vac}$ that drives cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we show that photons traversing this time-evolving dielectric undergo a "Permittivity Redshift" indistinguishable from standard expansion, resolving the Hubble Tension.

	\section{1. Introduction: The Vacuum Catastrophe}
	
	In General Relativity, the vacuum expectation value of the energy density is assumed to be zero (or renormalization requires fine-tuning to $10^{-120}$). The discovery of accelerated expansion ($\ddot{a} > 0$) necessitated the reintroduction of $\Lambda$ as a repulsive force.
	
	**The Dynamic Relativity Hypothesis:**
	We propose that the universe is not merely expanding in size, but evolving in \textit{phase}. The primordial vacuum was "Stiff" (Low Permittivity, $\mu \approx 0$). It is currently relaxing toward a "Soft" ground state (High Permittivity, $\mu \to \mu_{max}$).
	This relaxation process releases \textbf{Vacuum Potential Energy}. Just as a compressed spring pushes outward as it relaxes, the "compressed" geometry of the early universe exerts a repulsive pressure as the permittivity increases.
	
	\section{2. The Cosmological Permittivity Field}
	
	In Paper I, we defined the vacuum action with a kinetic term for $\mu$. For a homogeneous, isotropic universe (FLRW metric), the spatial gradients vanish ($\nabla \mu = 0$), and $\mu$ becomes a function solely of cosmic time $t$.
	
	\subsection{2.1 The Time-Dependent Metric}
	The modified line element is:
	\begin{equation}
		ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \mu(t)^{-1} \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2 \right)
	\end{equation}
	Note the factor $\mu(t)^{-1}$. As $\mu$ increases (vacuum softens), the effective scale factor changes. The geometry is determined by the interplay of the scale factor $a(t)$ and the dielectric factor $\mu(t)$.
	
	\section{3. The Dynamic Friedman Equations}
	
	We substitute the FLRW metric into the Master Field Equation derived in Paper I. The time-time component ($G_{00}$) gives the modified expansion rate.
	
	\subsection{3.1 The First Friedman Equation (Energy)}
	\begin{equation}
		H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_m + \underbrace{\frac{\omega}{3} \left( \frac{\dot{\mu}}{\mu} \right)^2 + V(\mu)}_{\rho_{vac}}
	\end{equation}
	Where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\rho_m$: Standard matter density (scales as $a^{-3}$).
		\item $\dot{\mu}/\mu$: The rate of vacuum relaxation.
		\item $V(\mu)$: The potential energy of the vacuum state.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{3.2 The Second Friedman Equation (Acceleration)}
	The acceleration equation depends on the pressure $P$.
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho_m + 3P_{vac})
	\end{equation}
	In standard physics, gravity is attractive because $\rho > 0$ and $P \approx 0$.
	In DR, we derive the \textbf{Vacuum Pressure} $P_{vac}$ from the scalar Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_\mu = \frac{1}{2}\dot{\mu}^2 - V(\mu)$.
	\begin{equation}
		P_{vac} = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\mu}^2 - V(\mu)
	\end{equation}
	If the vacuum is in a "slow-roll" relaxation phase where the potential energy dominates the kinetic change ($V(\mu) \gg \dot{\mu}^2$), then:
	\begin{equation}
		P_{vac} \approx -V(\mu) \approx -\rho_{vac}
	\end{equation}
	Substituting this into the acceleration equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho_m - 3\rho_{vac})
	\end{equation}
	When the universe dilutes enough that $\rho_{vac} > \rho_m / 3$, the term becomes positive.
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{ \ddot{a} > 0 }
	\end{equation}
	**Conclusion:** The universe accelerates not because of Dark Energy, but because the vacuum potential $V(\mu)$ acts as a negative pressure source driving the metric apart.
	
	\section{4. Gravitational Redshift (The Permittivity Shift)}
	
	Standard cosmology assumes redshift $z$ is purely kinematic (Doppler shift due to expansion). Dynamic Relativity introduces a second component: **Dielectric Degradation**.
	
	\subsection{4.1 The Photon Energy Equation}
	A photon with energy $E = \hbar \omega$ traveling through a changing dielectric medium obeys:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\dot{E}}{E} = - \frac{\dot{a}}{a} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\dot{\mu}}{\mu}
	\end{equation}
	* **Term 1:** Standard Hubble expansion (Space stretching).
	* **Term 2:** Dielectric Shift. As $\mu$ increases, the "optical density" of the vacuum changes.
	
	\subsection{4.2 The Total Redshift}
	The observed redshift $1+z$ is the product of the expansion factor and the permittivity factor:
	\begin{equation}
		1 + z_{obs} = \frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_{emit})} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\mu(t_0)}{\mu(t_{emit})}}
	\end{equation}
	This implies that distant galaxies appear redder not just because they are moving away, but because the vacuum *itself* was "stiffer" in the past.
	This resolves the **Hubble Tension** (the mismatch between local and CMB measurements of $H_0$). Local measurements see the combined effect ($H_{expansion} + H_{dielectric}$), while CMB models assume only $H_{expansion}$.

This pressure opposes the gravitational collapse of matter, driving the accelerated expansion of the voids between galaxy clusters.}

	\section{6. Conclusion}
	
	Dynamic Relativity provides a unified geometric solution to the Dark Energy problem. We have shown that the accelerated expansion of the universe is a mechanical consequence of **Vacuum Relaxation**.
	1.  **Acceleration:** The release of vacuum potential energy $V(\mu)$ generates a negative pressure ($P_{vac} < 0$), driving galaxies apart.
	2.  **Redshift:** The evolution of the permittivity field $\mu(t)$ adds a dielectric component to the redshift $z$, offering a solution to the Hubble Tension.
	
	By treating the vacuum as a dynamic substance rather than a static stage, we eliminate the need for the ad-hoc addition of $\Lambda$, restoring the physical intuition that geometry, not magic fluids, governs the cosmos.
