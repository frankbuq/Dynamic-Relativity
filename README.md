## 🌌 Overview
**Dynamic Relativity** is a theoretical generalization of Einstein's General Relativity. It challenges the standard assumption that the vacuum possesses a static, universal "stiffness" (defined by the constant $\kappa$).

Instead, this framework models the vacuum as a **Polarizable Dielectric Manifold**. It introduces a scalar field—**Gravitational Permittivity ($\mu$)**—which determines the local capacity of spacetime to curve. This simple relaxation of constraints leads to a rich new geometry that predicts:
* **Vacuum Wakes:** Time-dependent asymmetries in gravity for moving objects.
* **Singularity Resolution:** A "saturation" mechanism that replaces black hole singularities with finite-density cores.
* **Geometric "Fifth Forces":** Attraction mechanisms driven by permittivity gradients ($\nabla \mu$).

## 📄 Repository Contents

### **Paper I: The Geometric Formalism**
* **Status:** *Complete / Ready for Review*
* **Description:** The foundational document. It derives the Dynamic Field Equations from the Action Principle and establishes the differential geometry of a "dielectric" vacuum.
* **Key Contributions:**
    * Derivation of the Vacuum Stress Tensor $\Theta_{\mu\nu}$.
    * The "Permittivity Saturation" limit for $R \to \infty$.
    * Comparison of Affine Connections (Levi-Civita vs. Polarized).
    * Critical analysis of Solar System constraints (Cassini) and the Equivalence Principle.

### **Paper II: Rotational Vacuum Polarization**
* **Status:** *In Progress*
* **Description:** Application of the theory to the Solar System. Proposes that the Sun's rotation creates a "High-Permittivity Trench" along the equator, geometrically confining the planets to the orbital plane.

## 🛠 Usage
This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the theoretical papers.

### **Compiling Paper I**
To generate the PDF for Paper I, ensure you have a standard TeX distribution (TeX Live, MacTeX, or MikTeX).

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/dynamic-relativity.git
    cd dynamic-relativity
    ```
2.  **Add the Assets:**
    Ensure the following images are present in the root directory (or update the `.tex` file to point to your own images):
    * `example_image_placeholder_GR_wake.png` (Lorentz Contraction Diagram)
    * `example_image_placeholder_DR_wake.png` (Mach Cone/Cherenkov Diagram)

3.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    pdflatex paper_I_geometric_formalism.tex
    ```

## 🤖 Methodology: Human-AI Symbiosis
This project represents a new paradigm in theoretical research.
* **The Human Investigator** provides the intuitive leaps, the physical constraints, and the conceptual architecture (the "Spark").
* **The AI Co-Author** provides the formal mathematical derivations, the structural organization, and the rigorous stress-testing of arguments (the "Rigour").

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Dynamic Relativity is a **hypothetical framework**. While mathematically consistent, it is a proposal for a new geometric description of gravity and has not yet been validated by experimental observation.
